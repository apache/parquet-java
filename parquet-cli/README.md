## Building

You can build this project using maven:

```
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```


## Running

The build produces a shaded Jar that can be run using the `hadoop` command:

```
hadoop jar parquet-cli-1.12.3-runtime.jar org.apache.parquet.cli.Main
```

For a shorter command-line invocation, add an alias to your shell like this:

```
alias parquet="hadoop jar /path/to/parquet-cli-1.12.3-runtime.jar org.apache.parquet.cli.Main --dollar-zero parquet"
```

### Running without Hadoop

To run from the target directory instead of using the `hadoop` command, first copy the dependencies to a folder:

```
./mvnw dependency:copy-dependencies
```

Then, run the command-line and add `target/dependencies/*` to the classpath:

```
java -cp 'target/parquet-cli-1.12.3.jar:target/dependency/*' org.apache.parquet.cli.Main
```

Note that you shouldn't include the runtime jar used above into the classpath in this case.
In that jar, the `org.apache.avro package` is relocated for avoiding conflict with Hadoop's one.
That relocation changes method signatures, so it can cause `NoSuchMethodError` depending on the class loading order.
See PARQUET-2142 for details.


### Help

The `parquet` tool includes help for the included commands:

```
parquet help
```
```
