     * 1) Begin scanning the string until we find the first {
     *
     * 2) Now that we've found the beginning of a glob group, scan forwards
     *    until the end of this glob group (by counting { and } we see until we find
     *    the closing } for the group we found in step 1).
     *
     * 3) Once the matching closing } is found we need to do two things. First, everything
     *    from the end of the last group up to start of this group is an Atom, so in the example
     *    above, once we've found that "{one,pre{x,y}post,two}" is the first group, we need to grab
     *    "apache" and treat it as an atom and add it to our sequence.
     *    Then, we parse "{one,pre{x,y}post,two}" using a similar but slightly different function (parseOneOf)
     *    and add the result from that to our sequence.
     *
     * 4) Repeat until the end of the string -- so next we find {a,b} and add "parquet" as an Atom and parse
     *    {a,b} using parseOneOf.
