/**
 * Simple abstraction for file IO that allows Parquet components to work with
 * different storage back-ends (NIO, Hadoop, cloud SDKs, etc.) without taking
 * an explicit dependency on the back-end libraries.
 *
 * <p>The interface purposefully exposes a very small surface â€“ just the
 * operations currently needed by the Parquet code we intend to decouple from
 * Hadoop.  Additional methods can be added incrementally as other areas are
 * ported.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface lives in the <code>parquet-common</code> module so that it
 * can be referenced by any other module without creating additional coupling
 * between them.</p>
